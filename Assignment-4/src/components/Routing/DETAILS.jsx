Full stack development courses typically cover a wide range of technologies and skills required to develop both front-end and back-end aspects of web applications. Here's a general overview of what you might expect to learn in such a course:

HTML/CSS: These are the building blocks of web development. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the content of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout.

JavaScript: JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It's used for adding interactivity, dynamic behavior, and functionality to web pages. You'll likely learn about basic JavaScript syntax, DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.

Front-end Frameworks/Libraries: Courses may cover popular front-end frameworks and libraries like React.js, Angular, or Vue.js. These frameworks help in building interactive user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs).
